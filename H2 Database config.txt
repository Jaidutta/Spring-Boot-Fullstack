spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ddl_auto=none  means no action is being performed

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ddl_auto=update  means hibernat will change the database according to the entity structure
here the schema is not being created everytime but only the changes are being propogated-- recreation won't happen

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ddl_auto=create  means it would create the schema and it would destroy the previous data

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ddl_auto=create-drop  means it would drop when the session factory is created
here when the session factory is created the database is created and when the session is dropped, the database is dropped

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ddl_auto=create-drop is the default configuration

Difference between create and create-drop
create: the schema is created everytime the application starts

create-drop: when we start the application the schema is created and when we stop the application, the schema is also dropped
with create-drop the schema exists only until the lifecycle of the application. Once the session is dropped the schema is also dropped
