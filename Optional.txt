Optional is a container class in Java that can hold a non-null value or be empty. It's used to avoid NullPointerExceptions and make code more expressive.

Think of it like a box that can either contain a value or be empty. You can use methods like isPresent(), get(), orElse(), and orElseThrow() to interact with the value inside the box.

Here's a brief example:

java
CopyInsert
Optional<String> optionalString = Optional.of("Hello"); // create an Optional with a value
if (optionalString.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println(optionalString.get()); // prints "Hello"
}

Optional<String> emptyOptional = Optional.empty(); // create an empty Optional
System.out.println(emptyOptional.orElse("Default value")); // prints "Default value"
In the context of the original code snippet, findFirst() returns an Optional because it might not find a match. The orElseThrow() method is then used to handle the case where no match is found, by throwing an exception.

What do these each return: 
isPresent(), get(), orElse(), and orElseThrow() 
? 


Here's what each of these methods returns:

isPresent(): a boolean indicating whether the Optional contains a non-null value. Returns true if the value is present, false if it's empty.
get(): the non-null value contained in the Optional. If the Optional is empty, it throws a NoSuchElementException.
orElse(T other): the non-null value contained in the Optional, or the specified other value if the Optional is empty.
orElseThrow(Supplier<? extends X> exceptionSupplier): the non-null value contained in the Optional, or throws the exception produced by the exceptionSupplier if the Optional is empty.
In summary:

isPresent() asks "Is there a value?"
get() says "Give me the value!" (throws an exception if empty)
orElse() says "Give me the value, or this default value if it's empty"
orElseThrow() says "Give me the value, or throw this exception if it's empty"


what is this supplier?


In Java, a Supplier is a functional interface that represents a function that takes no arguments and returns a result.

In the context of orElseThrow(), the Supplier is a function that produces an exception when the Optional is empty. It's a way to lazily create an exception only when it's needed, rather than creating it upfront.

Think of it like a factory that creates an exception on demand. The Supplier is only invoked when the Optional is empty, and it returns the created exception, which is then thrown.

Here's an example:

java
CopyInsert
Optional<String> emptyOptional = Optional.empty();
emptyOptional.orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Value not found"));
In this case, the Supplier is a lambda expression that creates a RuntimeException with a message "Value not found". The exception is only created and thrown when the Optional is empty
